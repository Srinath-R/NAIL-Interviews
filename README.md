## Concurrency
Concurrency concepts are fundamental to modern software development. Here are key concepts to understand:

| Concept    | Purpose                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Lock       | Ensure only one thread accesses shared resource at a time |
| Semaphore  | Limit number of threads in a critical section             |
| Barrier    | Sync threads until all are ready                          |
| Event      | One thread signals others to proceed                      |
| Condition  | Thread coordination like producer-consumer                |
| Future     | Handle result of background computation using threads     |
